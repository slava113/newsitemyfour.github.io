        	<h2>1.Visual Studio Code</h2>
        	<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-vscode.jpg"></br>
        	<h5>Visual Studio Code is a free cross-platform code editor developed by Microsoft. The program is open source. Based on a survey conducted by Stack Overflow in 2017, this is one of the most popular code editors used by more than 24% of developers.
			It features an affordable set of editing and debugging tools. The editor integrates easily with other services. Its own properties are also easy to expand.
			The new Live Share feature provides opportunities for pair programming, so you and your team can easily work on the same code base. You do not have to configure development tools or tinker with the environment settings.
			In addition, among the features of VS Code, we see Git integration, IntelliSense (auto-completion technology), syntax highlighting for the most popular programming languages, and many other great features.
            If this is not enough for you, you can easily improve and customize VS Code thanks to a collection of plugins provided by Microsoft or created by the community.</h5></br>
			<h2>2.Sublime Text 3</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-sublime.jpg" class="dad" width="750px">
			<h5>
				Sublime Text 3 has a free and premium version. This is a cross-platform code editor. It is not only lightweight and very quick to use, but also expandable.

				This program can be downloaded completely free of charge on the official website and use it as much as you like in trial mode. You can then purchase the premium version for $ 80.

				By default, Sublime Text 3 provides basic auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and folding (folding) functionality. But using Package Control in Sublime Text, you can expand the latter and add more “lotions”: debugging tools, new ones, intellisense support, etc.

				The latest version of Sublime (3.1) also improved memory usage (in some cases up to 30%), appeared rendering text with ligature support, improved user interaction with the program, syntax definition and new color schemes were added.
			</h5>
			</br>
			<h2>3.Atom</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-atom.png">
			<h5>
				Atom is another free, open source cross-platform editor. It was created and released by GitHub.

				By default, Atom provides syntax highlighting, code addition and folding, and built-in support for dozens of programming languages.

				This editor also supports GitHub. It comes with a built-in package manager, so you can search, as well as install or create your own packages to expand the functionality of the editor.

				Like VS Code, it is also equipped with a powerful pair programming tool - Teletype. This enables several developers to join an isolated session and work together.

                Atom can be expanded with the Atom-IDE, a set of optional packages.
			</h5></br>
			<h2>4.Vim</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-vim.jpg">
			<h5>
				Vim is a powerful open source console editor. It is called to be, like Tolkien’s ring of omnipotence, “One to rule all.” Vim is preinstalled on almost any UNIX. The peculiarity of this editor is that it is 100% controlled using the keyboard (but if you want, you can use the mouse too). The main thing in it is not a beautiful appearance, but functionality.

                Although it is a very powerful editor, it is quite difficult to learn. But if you succeed, Vim will show you performance wonders: to complete some tasks that usually take time, you only need a few keystrokes.

				In the “out of the box” state, Vim can handle text quite well. But with plugins, scripts, and fine-tuning to suit your tastes, Vim becomes a powerful weapon in your arsenal.

                Compared to other (graphical) editors such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime or Atom, Vim provides the same functionality (if well configured), but uses only part of the system memory and loads instantly.
			</h5></br>
			<h2>5.Emacs</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-emacs.jpg">
			<h5>
				Emacs is another UNIX-based code editor. It is written in Lisp and can compete with Vim in usability and extensibility.

                By default, it provides content recognition editing modes, including syntax highlighting for many file types, full built-in documentation, and an introductory guide for new users.

                Emacs is highly customizable and has first-class support for Lisp and other functional languages. If you are familiar with Lisp, you can write the extension for this editor yourself, since it is free and has open source code.

                You can customize Emacs as you wish and implement functionality that goes beyond editing code, including
                project planning, using Emacs as an email client, newsreader, calendar, and more.

                Like Vim, Emacs is hard to learn: it may take some time to get comfortable with it and start using it to its full potential.

                However, unlike Vim, Emacs is not preinstalled on every Unix, and its memory usage is slightly higher, especially if you expand it using plugins.
			</h5></br>
			<h2>6.SpaceMacs</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-spacemacs.jpg">
			<h5>
				SpaceMacs is a community-created Emacs-based code editor. It provides syntax highlighting for major languages, as well as testing and debugging tools.

                This editor tries to combine the strengths of Vim and Emacs, allowing users to choose their preferred editing style.

                SpaceMacs is built around four basic principles: mnemonics, understandability, consistency, and configuration ability for a large number of people.

                Thus, using SpaceMacs, you can be sure that each key combination is organized with consecutive, mnemonic prefixes (for example, "p" means "project"). Thanks to this, the use of the editor becomes intuitive.

                SpaceMacs has a very active and helpful community, which you can join to get help and help other people.
			</h5></br>
			<h2>7.Notepad++</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-notepadplusplus.png">
			<h5>
				Notepad ++ is an advanced code editor released in 2003 and available only on the Windows platform.

                It not only passed the test of time, but also became the second most popular code editor in the 2017 StackOverflow survey. It is used by  more than 34% of developers.

                Notepad ++ is very fast. It supports a variety of programming languages ​​right out of the box, but is widely known as a great editor for HTML code.

                Among its features can be called editing in different tabs, support for external plug-ins, such as macros, smart syntax highlighting, compiler integration, auto-completion and indenting.
			</h5></br>
			<h2>8.Brackets</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-brackets.png">
			<h5>
				Brackets is an open-source cross-platform editor developed and released by Adobe under the MIT license.

                It was created from scratch especially for web designers and front-end developers working primarily with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

                Brackets also comes with basic standard features, including auto-completion, syntax highlighting for many programming languages, support for quick editing, and a variety of preprocessors.

                Its distinctive features include the Live Preview option. With it, a developer can open the current document in Chrome and view how the document is displayed in the browser.

				Brackets also has a “extract” property, which allows developers to pull colors, sizes, gradients, fonts, and other important data from a PSD file into a ready-to-use CSS file.

				Finally, Brackets is very customizable, and its main functionality can be increased with the help of extensions available in the official registry.
			</h5></br>
			<h2>9.TextMate</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-textmate.jpg">
			<h5>
				TextMate is considered the "missing editor" for Mac OS, combining the graphical user interface and the UNIX system structure.

                Although TextMate is open source, it is a commercial product released under the BSD license. Its price is $ 60.

                By default, this editor has its own powerful functionality, including search and replace, column selection, collapsible blocks of code, code addition, basic syntax highlighting for dozens of programming languages, and much more.

                TextMate also has the benefits of a strong community and accessible documentation. Plugins and themes are both official and submitted by users.
			</h5></br>
			<h2>10.Coda 2</h2>
			<img src="https://techrocks.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/code-editors-coda.jpg">
			<h5>
				Coda 2 is a good code editor for Mac OS and iOS. It was developed and released by Panic Inc, the company that gave us Transmit, Prompt, and finally Firewatch (a game with a scene in the Wyoming deserts).

                This editor costs $ 99, but you can use it for free for a 7-day trial period.

                Coda is a powerful code editor designed with thoughts on performance and efficiency. It has a modern and intuitive user interface. The program comes with features such as code addition, syntax highlighting for various languages, MySQL support, local indexing, etc.
				The editor has built-in functionality for opening and managing your local and remote files, as well as a built-in terminal for quick access. In terms of documentation and support, Coda also does not graze the rear - the editor has a very active community.

                If the functionality installed by default is not enough for you, you can select plugins to expand it. They are developed by both Panic Inc. and the community.
            </h5></br>
            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
            <h5> Choosing the best code editor is always subjective. But I think it’s best to try them all for a few days to figure out which one is right for you.

			As soon as you find an editor suitable for you, stop your choice on it and study it up and down. Thus, you will give him a chance to prove that he is really the best editor, providing you with the highest productivity in your work.
